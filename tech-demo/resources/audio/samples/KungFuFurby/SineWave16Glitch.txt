Created using Terrific Audio Driver v0.0.13 using a 16 sample sine wave, then using the converter in a way to produce an unintended result using a loop setting of Dupe Block Hack, BRR Filter 2, 1 duplicate block. To avoid inconsistencies from converter bugfixes, a BRR file was used here so that the result can be preserved for, though the .wav of the file itself that was imported from is also provided.

For the sine wave itself, it was generated with Audacity 2.4.2:
Project rate was set to 8363hz
Waveform was set to Sine
Frequency was set to 522.6875hz (a 16th of the project rate, meaning the sine wave does one cycle)
Amplitude was set to 1
